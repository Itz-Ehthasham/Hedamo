# Docker Setup Fix

## Issue: Docker Engine Not Running

### Solution 1: Start Docker Desktop
1. **Open Docker Desktop** application
2. **Wait for it to fully start** (whale icon in system tray should be stable)
3. **Run as Administrator** if needed

### Solution 2: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
1. **Right-click** on Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. **Select "Run as Administrator"**
3. **Navigate to project directory**
4. **Run docker-compose command**

### Solution 3: Alternative Docker Commands
```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker --version

# Start Docker service (if using Docker without Desktop)
net start com.docker.service

# Build and run with verbose output
docker-compose up --build --verbose
```

### Solution 4: Use Development Mode Instead
If Docker continues to have issues, run in development mode:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Run all services locally
npm run dev
```

## Verification
After starting Docker Desktop, verify with:
```bash
docker ps
docker-compose --version
```
